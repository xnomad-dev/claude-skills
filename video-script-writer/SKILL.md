# Video Script

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Write a ready-to-film script for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Reels, or course content
- Structure a talking head, tutorial, or short-form video with proper segments and timing
- Add production cues like [B-ROLL], [TEXT ON SCREEN], and [CUT TO] so a solo creator can film without a producer
- Turn a topic, outline, or rough notes into a complete script with hook, body, and CTA
- Generate a shot list so the creator knows every setup before they press record

**DO NOT** use this skill for podcast scripts (audio-only, no visual cues needed), written blog posts, or live-stream outlines where scripting kills spontaneity.

## Core Principle

EVERY SECOND OF VIDEO MUST EARN THE NEXT SECOND — IF THE VIEWER HAS NO REASON TO KEEP WATCHING, THEY LEAVE.

---

## Video Format Quick Reference

| Format | Target Length | Pacing | Hook Window | Segments |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| YouTube long-form | 8-15 min | Visual change every 5-8 sec | First 3 sec | 4-6 + intro/outro |
| Short-form (Reel/TikTok/Short) | 30-60 sec | Visual change every 2-3 sec | First 1-2 sec | Hook + 1-3 points + CTA |
| Tutorial | 5-10 min | Match pacing to steps | First 5 sec | Setup + 3-5 steps + recap |
| Talking head | 3-5 min | Cut every 10-15 sec | First 3 sec | 2-3 segments + CTA |

---

## Phase 1: Brief

Gather these details before writing anything. Ask for anything the user does not provide.

1. **Topic** — the specific angle, not just the broad subject
2. **Format** — YouTube long-form, short-form reel, tutorial, or talking head (default: YouTube long-form)
3. **Target length** — use quick reference defaults if not specified
4. **Key points** — 3-5 things the video must cover, in priority order
5. **CTA** — what should the viewer do after watching? (subscribe, visit link, comment, try something)
6. **Tone** — default: conversational and direct, like explaining to a smart friend
7. **Audience** — default: entrepreneurs and solo creators

Present the brief back to the user:

```
## Script Brief

**Topic:** 5 tools every solopreneur needs to save 10+ hours per week
**Format:** YouTube long-form (8-10 minutes)
**Key points:**
1. Project management (Notion)
2. Scheduling (Cal.com)
3. Email automation (Kit)
4. Design (Canva)
5. AI writing assistant (Claude)
**CTA:** Subscribe + link to free tool comparison PDF in description
**Tone:** Conversational, enthusiastic but not hype-y
**Audience:** Solo founders and freelancers in their first 2 years
```

**GATE: Do not proceed to Phase 2 until the user confirms or adjusts the brief.**

---

## Phase 2: Structure

Build the script skeleton before writing full dialogue. This prevents rambling and keeps every segment purposeful.

### Hook Formula (First 3 Seconds)

Pick the hook type that fits the topic best:

| Hook Type | Structure | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Pattern interrupt** | Say/show something unexpected that breaks the scroll | Short-form, entertainment |
| **Bold claim** | State a specific, provocative result or opinion | Long-form, authority content |
| **Direct question** | Ask a question the target audience cannot ignore | Tutorials, how-to content |

**Hook rules:**
- **NEVER** start with "Hey guys, welcome to my channel" — instant skip
- **NEVER** start with "In this video, I'm going to..." — show, do not preview
- The hook must work with NO context — assume the viewer knows nothing about you

### Outline Template

Build and present this structure:

```
## Script Outline

**HOOK** (0:00-0:08) — Bold claim: "These 5 tools replaced my entire team."

**Segment 1: The Problem** (0:08-1:00)
- Why solopreneurs waste 15+ hours/week on tasks tools can handle
- Transition: "Let me show you what I use instead."

**Segment 2: Tool #1 — Notion** (1:00-2:30)
- What it replaces, one specific workflow, result
- [B-ROLL: screen recording of Notion dashboard]

**Segment 3: Tool #2 — Cal.com** (2:30-3:45)
- What it replaces, one specific workflow, result
- [B-ROLL: screen recording of booking page]

**Segment 4: Tool #3 — Kit** (3:45-5:15)
- What it replaces, one specific automation, result

**Segment 5: Tool #4 — Canva** (5:15-6:30)
- What it replaces, one specific design use case, result

**Segment 6: Tool #5 — Claude** (6:30-7:45)
- What it replaces, one specific prompt workflow, result

**RECAP + CTA** (7:45-8:30)
- Quick recap of all 5 tools
- CTA: subscribe + free comparison PDF in description
```

**GATE: Do not proceed to Phase 3 until the user approves the outline.**

---

## Phase 3: Write

Write the complete script with all production cues. Every line the creator reads on camera is written out. Every visual change is marked.

### Production Cue Format

| Cue | When to Use | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `[B-ROLL: description]` | Supplementary footage over narration | `[B-ROLL: screen recording of Notion kanban board]` |
| `[TEXT ON SCREEN: text]` | Key phrases, stats, or labels overlaid | `[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Tool #1: Notion"]` |
| `[CAPTION: text]` | Burned-in or styled caption for muted viewers — use on key phrases, stats, and punchlines | `[CAPTION: "3+ hours saved every single week"]` |
| `[CUT TO: shot type]` | Camera angle or framing change | `[CUT TO: tight shot, speaker looking into camera]` |
| `[SFX: description]` | Sound effect or music change | `[SFX: upbeat intro music fades in]` |
| `[PAUSE: Xs]` | Intentional beat for emphasis | `[PAUSE: 2s]` |

> **Captions note:** Most short-form viewers watch on mute. Mark every key stat, punchline, and CTA with a `[CAPTION:]` cue so the editor knows what must be readable without sound. For long-form, caption the hook and CTA at minimum.

### Script Writing Rules

- **Write exactly what the creator will say.** No summaries, no "talk about X here."
- **One idea per segment.** If a segment covers two ideas, split it.
- **Visual change every 5-8 seconds** for long-form, **every 2-3 seconds** for short-form.
- **Mark every transition** between segments with a production cue.
- **Include timing estimates** at the start of each segment: `(MM:SS-MM:SS ~Xs)`.
- **Bold the first line of each segment** so the creator can scan while filming.

### Example 1: YouTube Long-Form — "5 Tools Every Solopreneur Needs" (8 min)

Below is the hook, one full segment, and the recap/CTA. Apply this same format to every segment in the script.

```
## HOOK (0:00-0:08 ~8s)

[CUT TO: medium shot, speaker holds up phone showing app grid]

**"These five tools replaced my entire team."**

I run a one-person business that does six figures a year.
No VA. No contractor. Just me and these five tools.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "5 Tools That Replaced My Team"]
[CAPTION: "5 Tools That Replaced My Team"]

And by the end of this video, you'll have the exact
setup I use — plus a free cheat sheet in the description.

---

## SEGMENT 1: THE PROBLEM (0:08-1:00 ~52s)

[CUT TO: talking head, wide shot]

**"Here's the thing nobody tells you about going solo."**

When you start a business by yourself, you don't just
do the work — you do EVERYTHING. You're the CEO, the
marketer, the accountant, the customer support rep,
the designer, and the IT department.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "CEO + Marketer + Accountant + Support + Designer + IT"]

And most solopreneurs spend 15 or more hours a week
on stuff that has nothing to do with making money.
Admin. Scheduling. Formatting. Busywork.

[B-ROLL: time-lapse of messy desk with papers and sticky notes]

I used to be there. I was working 60-hour weeks and
wondering why my revenue wasn't growing. Then I made
one change.

[PAUSE: 1s]

I built a five-tool system that handles 80% of the
operational work automatically. Let me show you what I use.

---

## SEGMENT 2: TOOL #1 — NOTION (1:00-2:30 ~90s)

[CUT TO: talking head, medium shot]
[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Tool #1: Notion"]
[CAPTION: "Tool #1: Notion"]
[SFX: subtle whoosh transition sound]

**"Tool number one — Notion — and this is the command center."**

Before Notion, I had tasks in Apple Notes, project
details in Google Docs, and client info in a spreadsheet.
Three places to check before I could start actual work.

[B-ROLL: screen recording — Notion dashboard showing kanban board, database, and calendar view]

Now everything lives here. My task board, my content
calendar, my client database, my SOPs — all in one
workspace.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Tasks + Calendar + Clients + SOPs = 1 workspace"]

Here's my actual workflow: every Monday I open this
dashboard, check my weekly tasks, and drag my top 3
priorities to the "Today" column. That's it. No more
wondering what to do first.

[B-ROLL: screen recording — dragging 3 tasks to "Today" column]

The result? I cut my planning time from 45 minutes
a day to 5 minutes. That's over 3 hours a week back.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "45 min/day → 5 min/day = 3+ hours saved/week"]
[CAPTION: "45 min → 5 min = 3+ hours saved every week"]

---

(Segments 3-6 follow the same format: [CUT TO] + [TEXT ON SCREEN] label
+ bold opening line + dialogue with [B-ROLL] cues + stat callout.)

---

## RECAP + CTA (7:45-8:30 ~45s)

[CUT TO: talking head, wide shot — same framing as opening]

**"So here's the full stack."**

[TEXT ON SCREEN: list appearing one by one]

Notion for project management. Cal.com for scheduling.
Kit for email. Canva for design. Claude for thinking.

Five tools, under 100 dollars a month total, and they
save me 10 or more hours every single week.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "5 tools — <$100/mo — 10+ hours saved/week"]
[CAPTION: "5 tools · <$100/mo · 10+ hours saved/week"]

I put together a free comparison sheet with pricing,
links, and my exact setup for each tool. It is in
the description below — go grab it.

[B-ROLL: arrow graphic pointing downward toward description area]

If this was helpful, hit subscribe. I make videos
like this every week about running a one-person
business that actually scales.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "SUBSCRIBE for more solo business systems"]
[CAPTION: "SUBSCRIBE for more solo business systems"]

And if you're already using any of these tools, drop
a comment and tell me which one is your favorite.
I read every single one.

[SFX: end screen music fades in]
[CUT TO: end screen with subscribe button and suggested video card]
```

### Timing Validation

After writing, use Bash to count spoken dialogue words and validate against targets:

```bash
# Count words in spoken dialogue only (exclude lines starting with [ or #)
grep -v '^\[' script.md | grep -v '^#' | grep -v '^---' | wc -w
```

- **Speaking pace:** 130-160 words per minute (conversational, not rushed)
- **YouTube 8-15 min:** 1,040-2,400 words of spoken dialogue
- **Short-form 30-60 sec:** 65-160 words
- **Tutorial 5-10 min:** 650-1,600 words
- **Talking head 3-5 min:** 390-800 words

> **Pace varies by creator.** 130-160 WPM is a baseline for natural, conversational delivery. High-energy creators (short-form, fast-cut YouTube) may speak at 170-190 WPM; calm tutorial presenters may sit at 110-130 WPM. If the creator's style is known, adjust word count targets accordingly. When unsure, ask: "Read one paragraph aloud and time yourself — how many seconds did it take?"

If word count is more than 15% over target, trim the weakest segment. If more than 15% under, add depth to existing segments — never add filler.

**GATE: Present the complete script. Do not finalize until the user approves content, tone, and length.**

---

## Phase 4: Deliver

Once approved, deliver the final package with these components.

### 1. Final Script File

Write the complete script to a file if the user requests it. Default filename: `video-script.md`.

### 2. Shot List Summary

Append a table listing every unique camera setup and visual asset:

```
## Shot List

| # | Shot Type | Description | Duration | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Medium shot | Speaker holding phone, app grid visible | 8s | Hook — high energy |
| 2 | Wide talking head | Speaker at desk | 52s | Segment 1 |
| 3 | Screen recording | Notion dashboard — kanban, calendar | 30s | Segment 2 B-roll |
| 4 | Screen recording | Cal.com booking page | 15s | Segment 3 B-roll |
| 5 | Screen recording | Kit automation flow | 30s | Segment 4 B-roll |
| 6 | Screen recording | Canva template + export | 20s | Segment 5 B-roll |
| 7 | Screen recording | Claude outline workflow | 20s | Segment 6 B-roll |
| 8 | Wide talking head | Same framing as hook | 45s | Recap + CTA |
| 9 | End screen | Subscribe button + suggested video | 15s | Outro |

**Total setups:** 3 camera positions + 5 screen recordings + 1 end screen
**Estimated filming time:** 45-60 minutes (with retakes)
```

### 3. Text Overlay List

Extract all `[TEXT ON SCREEN]` cues into a standalone list with timestamps for the editor.

### 4. Captions List

Extract all `[CAPTION:]` cues into a standalone list with timestamps. Note the caption strategy for the editor:

- **Short-form (Reels/TikTok/Shorts):** Burn in captions — most viewers watch on mute, captions are non-negotiable.
- **YouTube long-form:** Auto-generated captions are acceptable, but manually style the hook and CTA captions for visual impact.
- **Tutorial:** Auto-generated is fine; flag any technical terms that auto-captions are likely to misspell.

### 5. Pre-Filming Checklist

```
## Pre-Filming Checklist

- [ ] Script printed or on teleprompter/tablet
- [ ] All screen recordings captured and labeled
- [ ] Camera framing set for each shot type (wide, medium, tight)
- [ ] Audio levels tested (lapel mic or shotgun mic positioned)
- [ ] Lighting consistent across all talking head shots
- [ ] B-roll footage list reviewed — nothing missing
- [ ] Text overlay list sent to editor (or saved for self-editing)
- [ ] Captions strategy decided: burned-in (Reels/Shorts), auto-generated (YouTube), or manual SRT
- [ ] [CAPTION:] cue list exported and shared with editor
- [ ] CTA link/resource is live and tested before publishing
```

## Example 2: Short-Form Instagram Reel — "One Productivity Tip in 30 Seconds"

```
## Script Brief

**Topic:** The 2-minute rule for beating procrastination
**Format:** Instagram Reel / Short-form (30 seconds)
**Key points:**
1. If a task takes under 2 minutes, do it immediately
2. It eliminates the mental pile-up of tiny tasks
**CTA:** Follow for more productivity tips
**Tone:** High energy, punchy, direct
```

```
## HOOK (0:00-0:03 ~3s)

[CUT TO: tight shot, speaker snaps fingers]

**"You're procrastinating wrong."**

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "THE 2-MINUTE RULE"]
[CAPTION: "THE 2-MINUTE RULE"]

---

## POINT (0:03-0:22 ~19s)

[CUT TO: medium shot, speaker talking fast and direct]

Here's the rule: if something takes less than two
minutes — replying to that email, putting away the
dishes, sending that invoice — do it NOW.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "< 2 minutes? Do it NOW."]
[CAPTION: "< 2 minutes? Do it NOW."]

Not later. Not after lunch. Right now.

[B-ROLL: rapid montage — typing email, filing paper, clicking "send" on invoice]

Because those tiny tasks pile up in your brain and
drain your focus on the stuff that actually matters.

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Small tasks pile up → big mental drain"]

---

## CTA (0:22-0:30 ~8s)

[CUT TO: tight shot, speaker points at camera]

**"Try it for one day. You'll feel the difference by noon."**

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "FOLLOW for daily productivity tips"]
[CAPTION: "FOLLOW for daily productivity tips"]

Follow for more.

[SFX: upbeat stinger to end]
```

**Shot list:** 2 camera positions (tight, medium) + 3 B-roll clips (email, filing, invoice at 1.5-2s each). Estimated filming time: 10-15 minutes.

---

## Anti-Patterns

**NEVER do these when writing video scripts:**

- **Essay-style writing** — scripts are spoken language. Short sentences. Contractions. Fragments are fine. If it sounds stiff read aloud, rewrite it.
- **Skipping the hook** — "Let me introduce myself" is not a hook. The first 3 seconds must give the viewer a reason to stay.
- **Forgetting visual cues** — a script with no [B-ROLL], [TEXT ON SCREEN], or [CUT TO] tags is just an essay. If there are no visual changes for 15+ seconds, the viewer is gone.
- **Skipping captions on short-form** — most Reels, TikToks, and Shorts are watched on mute. If the key message isn't readable, it doesn't land. Every punchline, stat, and CTA needs a [CAPTION:] cue.
- **Walls of dialogue** — no segment should run longer than 90 seconds without a visual change. Break it up.
- **Vague B-roll descriptions** — "[B-ROLL: something relevant]" is useless. Be specific: "[B-ROLL: screen recording of Notion kanban board with 3 tasks in the Today column]."
- **Multiple CTAs** — one video, one CTA. Do not ask them to subscribe AND follow AND buy AND join.
- **No timing estimates** — a script without timing is a guess. Always include per-segment timing.
- **Writing for readers, not speakers** — use "you'll" not "you will," "can't" not "cannot." Read it out loud. If you stumble, simplify.

---

## Recovery

- **Vague topic** ("make a video about marketing"): Ask "What one thing about marketing should the viewer know after watching?" Narrow until you have a concrete angle.
- **No clear CTA**: Ask "What one thing do you want the viewer to do after watching — subscribe, follow, visit a link, try something, or leave a comment?" If they still can't decide, default to "subscribe and comment below." Note they can swap it before publishing.
- **No CTA idea at all**: Use "subscribe + comment with [relevant question tied to the video topic]" as a placeholder. This keeps engagement active and gives the creator something to replace once they have a resource or offer ready.
- **Script runs too long**: Cut the weakest segment first. Reduce examples from 2 to 1 per segment. Never speed up pacing — trim content instead.
- **Script runs too short**: Add depth to existing segments (specific examples, a brief story, a "common mistake" callout). Never add filler segments.
- **Unknown format**: Ask for target length, platform, and audience. Build using the same Phase 1-4 workflow.
- **If 3 revision attempts fail**: **Stop and reassess.** Ask the user to record a 2-minute voice memo explaining what they want. Use that as source material for tone, pacing, and vocabulary. Restart from Phase 2.

---

## Quick Reference: Script Math

| Format | Words | Segments | Visual Changes | Hook Window |
|--------|-------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| YouTube 8-15 min | 1,040-2,400 | 4-6 + intro/outro | Every 5-8 sec | 3 seconds |
| Short-form 30-60 sec | 65-160 | 1-3 + hook/CTA | Every 2-3 sec | 1-2 seconds |
| Tutorial 5-10 min | 650-1,600 | 3-5 steps + recap | Every 5-8 sec | 5 seconds |
| Talking head 3-5 min | 390-800 | 2-3 + CTA | Every 10-15 sec | 3 seconds |

**Speaking pace:** 130-160 words per minute for natural, conversational delivery. Adjust targets if the creator's natural pace is faster or slower (see Timing Validation for guidance).
